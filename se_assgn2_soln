	ii. Reduces Risk: Identifies potential issues early, reducing the risk of project failure.
	iii. Facilitates Communication: Provides a clear and shared understanding of the project scope among stakeholders.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

# Concept:
	Modularity refers to the design principle of breaking down a software system into smaller, manageable, and independent modules. Each module encapsulates a specific functionality and can be developed, tested, and maintained separately.

# Improvement in Maintainability and Scalability:
	# i. Maintainability: Easier to locate and fix bugs, as changes to one module do not affect others.
	# ii. Scalability: New features can be added by creating new modules or modifying existing ones without impacting the entire system.
	# iii. Reusability: Modules can be reused across different parts of the application or in other projects.
	Example: In a web application, separating user authentication, database operations, and UI rendering into different modules.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
# I. Unit Testing:
	Tests individual units or components of the software.
	Ensures that each unit functions correctly in isolation.
	Example: Testing a function that calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart.

# II. Integration Testing:
	Tests the interactions between integrated units or components.
	Ensures that combined parts of the system work together.
	Example: Testing the interaction between the database and the application logic.

# III. System Testing:
	Tests the entire system as a whole.
	Ensures that the system meets the specified requirements.
	Example: Testing the complete web application to verify it performs all user functions.

# IV. Acceptance Testing:
	Validates the system against user requirements.
	Ensures the software is ready for delivery to the end-user.
	Example: Conducting user acceptance testing (UAT) where end-users validate the system.

# Importance of Testing:
	Ensures Quality: Detects and fixes defects early, ensuring the software meets quality standards.
	Reduces Costs: Identifying and resolving issues early reduces the cost of fixing them later.
	Increases User Satisfaction: Ensures the software meets user expectations and requirements.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
